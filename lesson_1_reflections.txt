How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Comparing files can help to find typos in the middle of lines and easily solve it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Sometimes you make some change and forget where. Having this Undo button can save a lot of time finding a bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

In Google you will always have the most updated version and if something goes wrong with your machine, everything is saved in the cloud. So you dont miss any previous job. On the other hand, Git will always keep an working version and if you commit something new and discover some bug, you can easily go back.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I dont know that.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
