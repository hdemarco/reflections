When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Usually when you need to share it with someone or you want to work in a different computer, like your work computer and your personal computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes you dont want to make your job public.
